# HipStamp / ChannelAdvisor Inventory Sync App

## Description
The HipStamp / ChannelAdvisor Inventory Sync App is a Windows-based desktop application designed to automate inventory management between the e-commerce platforms HipStamp and ChannelAdvisor. It synchronizes inventory by adjusting quantities on one platform based on sales on the other, ensuring consistent inventory records. The app also features a functionality to compare product quantities on both platforms, aiding in accuracy verification and manual correction. The app was created for a single specific client, but if interest exists, I intend to modify it to allow for a wider user base.

## Features
- **Inventory Sync**: Updates inventory quantities across platforms following a sale.
- **Sales Log Viewing**: Accesses a detailed log of both updated products and non-updatable products, along with reasons why products could not be updated.
- **Quantity Comparison**: Compares product quantities on both platforms to ensure sync accuracy.
- **Customizable Settings**: Modifies the start date and time for inventory sync, tailoring it to specific needs.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for developing the application.
- **API Integration**: Enables communication between the HipStamp and ChannelAdvisor platforms for data synchronization.

## Installation and Setup
1. Download the app to your PC.
2. Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access both HipStamp and ChannelAdvisor platforms.
3. Modify the `config.json` file with your specific details (placeholder values provided).

## Usage
- **Run**: Initiates the inventory sync process.
- **View Log**: Displays a detailed log of inventory updates and sync issues.
- **Compare Quantities**: Shows a comparison of product quantities across platforms.
- **Settings**: Adjusts the sync settings, including the date and time for new sales checks.

## Configuration

## Screenshots

## Future Enhancements
If interest exists, the following enhancements are planned for a future version:
- An expanded Settings section that will allow the user to enter their own information (i.e. usernames, passwords, etc.), which will be stored in config.json.
- A Mac-based version.

## For Prospective Employers
This app demonstrates my capabilities in automating complex e-commerce operations, handling synchronization tasks across multiple platforms, and API integrations. It showcases problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and an understanding of real-world business needs in the e-commerce sector.
